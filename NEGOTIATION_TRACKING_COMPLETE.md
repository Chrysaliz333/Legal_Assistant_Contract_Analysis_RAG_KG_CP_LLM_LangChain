# Negotiation Tracking - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend Service (`src/services/negotiation_tracker.py`)

**Full-featured version tracking system:**

✅ **Core Features:**
- Store multiple versions of the same contract
- Track metadata: timestamp, uploader (internal/counterparty), notes
- SHA-256 hash-based duplicate detection
- Unified diff generation for version comparison
- Timeline view of all versions
- JSON file-based storage (no database required)

✅ **Data Model:**
```python
@dataclass
class ContractVersion:
    version_id: str              # "acme_saas_v1", "acme_saas_v2", etc.
    negotiation_id: str          # "acme_saas"
    version_number: int          # 1, 2, 3...
    contract_text: str           # Full contract text
    uploaded_at: str             # ISO timestamp
    uploaded_by: str             # 'internal' or 'counterparty'
    file_hash: str               # SHA-256 hash (first 16 chars)
    analysis_result: Dict        # Full unified agent analysis
    notes: str                   # User notes about this version
```

✅ **Key Methods:**
- `create_negotiation()` - Start new negotiation
- `add_version()` - Add new contract version
- `get_version()` - Load specific version
- `compare_versions()` - Generate diff between versions
- `get_negotiation_timeline()` - Chronological history
- `list_negotiations()` - All negotiations

### 2. Streamlit UI Integration (`app_unified.py`)

**Complete UI for negotiation tracking:**

✅ **Sidebar - Negotiation Management:**
```python
# Negotiation selector
- List existing negotiations with version count
- "+ Start New Negotiation" option
- Create new negotiation with custom title
- Auto-selects current negotiation
```

✅ **Upload Form - Version Metadata:**
```python
# Two new inputs added:
1. Radio button: "This version is from"
   - Options: internal | counterparty

2. Text input: "Notes (optional)"
   - Placeholder: e.g., "Counterparty increased liability cap"
```

✅ **Analysis Integration - Auto-Save:**
```python
# After analysis completes:
1. Save version with metadata
2. Store full analysis results
3. Show success: "✅ Saved as acme_saas_v1"
4. Handle duplicates: "⚠️ Duplicate version detected"
```

✅ **Timeline View - Version History:**
```python
# Shows all versions chronologically:
- Version number + uploader + date
- Expandable cards for each version
- Displays: timestamp, source, notes
- Analysis summary: total findings, severity counts, suggested edits
```

✅ **Comparison UI - Side-by-Side Diff:**
```python
# Compare any two versions:
1. Dropdown: Select "Base Version"
2. Dropdown: Select "Compare To"
3. Button: "Compare Selected Versions"
4. Output: Unified diff format
   - Red lines: Deletions (-)
   - Green lines: Additions (+)
   - Summary: additions/deletions count
```

### 3. Testing Suite

✅ **Backend Test (`test_negotiation_tracking.py`):**
- Creates test negotiation
- Adds 2 versions with different text
- Compares versions and shows diff
- Displays timeline
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing

✅ **Test Contracts:**
- `sample_msa.txt` - Original vendor-friendly contract (Version 1)
- `sample_msa_v2.txt` - Counterparty response with 13 key changes (Version 2)

✅ **Testing Guide (`NEGOTIATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md`):**
- Step-by-step testing workflow
- Expected results for each step
- Success criteria checklist
- Troubleshooting guide

## How It Works - Full Workflow

### Round 1: Initial Upload

```
User Actions:
1. Create negotiation: "Acme Corp MSA Negotiation"
2. Upload sample_msa.txt
3. Select: This is from "internal"
4. Add note: "Initial draft from legal team"
5. Click "Analyze Contract"

System:
1. ✅ Creates negotiation (if new)
2. ✅ Runs unified agent analysis
3. ✅ Saves as Version 1 with metadata
4. ✅ Stores analysis results
5. ✅ Shows findings + timeline (1 version)
```

### Round 2: Counterparty Response

```
User Actions:
1. Same negotiation auto-selected
2. Upload sample_msa_v2.txt
3. Select: This is from "counterparty"
4. Add note: "Counterparty improved liability, IP, and SLA"
5. Click "Analyze Contract"

System:
1. ✅ Checks for duplicate (SHA-256 hash)
2. ✅ Runs unified agent analysis on v2
3. ✅ Saves as Version 2 with metadata
4. ✅ Stores analysis results
5. ✅ Shows findings + timeline (2 versions)
```

### Round 3: Comparison

```
User Actions:
1. Scroll to "Compare Versions"
2. Base: "Version 1"
3. Compare: "Version 2"
4. Click "Compare Selected Versions"

System:
1. ✅ Loads both contract texts
2. ✅ Generates unified diff
3. ✅ Displays changes:
   - Liability cap: 1× → 1.5×
   - IP ownership: revocable → perpetual
   - Termination: 30 → 60 days
   - Governing law: Cayman Islands → Delaware
   - etc. (13 total changes)
4. ✅ Shows statistics:
   - Additions: ~15-20 lines
   - Deletions: ~15-20 lines
```

## Data Storage

**File Structure:**
```
negotiations/
├── acme_saas_negotiation.json           # Negotiation metadata
├── acme_saas_v1.json                    # Version 1 full data
├── acme_saas_v2.json                    # Version 2 full data
└── acme_saas_v3.json                    # Version 3 full data
```

**Negotiation File (`*_negotiation.json`):**
```json

✅ **No Database Needed** - Simple JSON files work on Streamlit Cloud
✅ **Duplicate Prevention** - SHA-256 hashing prevents identical uploads
✅ **Automatic Timeline** - Chronological history of all versions
✅ **Rich Metadata** - Track who uploaded (internal/counterparty) and why
✅ **Integrated Analysis** - Each version stores full analysis results
✅ **Flexible Comparison** - Compare any two versions (not just sequential)
✅ **Standard Diff Format** - Unified diff (same as Git/GitHub)

   - Upload v2, verify timeline updates
   - Compare v1 vs v2, verify diff
   - Test duplicate detection

2. **Bug Fixes** (if needed)
   - Fix any issues found during testing
   - Adjust UI/UX based on feedback

### Deployment:
3. **Streamlit Cloud Deployment**
   - Commit all changes
   - Push to repository
   - Deploy updated app
   - Verify `negotiations/` directory works on cloud

4. **Production Monitoring**
   - Monitor file storage growth
   - Check diff performance with large contracts
   - Gather user feedback

## Known Limitations

⚠️ **Current Limitations:**
1. **File-Based Storage** - Not ideal for teams (consider PostgreSQL for multi-user)
2. **No Locking** - Two simultaneous uploads could conflict
3. **Linear History** - No branching like Git
4. **No Search** - Can't search across all versions (yet)
5. **Storage Growth** - Each version stores full contract text

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- For enterprise: Migrate to database
- For teams: Add file locking mechanism
- For large contracts: Consider compression
- For search: Add full-text search index

## Usage Example

**Scenario: SaaS contract negotiation**

```
Day 1: Internal team uploads initial draft
→ Version 1 saved as "internal" with analysis showing 8 policy violations

Day 3: Counterparty sends back redlines
→ Version 2 saved as "counterparty" with analysis showing 5 remaining violations
→ Compare v1 vs v2: Shows counterparty improved liability cap and IP terms

Day 5: Internal team sends counter-proposal
→ Version 3 saved as "internal" with analysis showing 2 remaining violations
→ Compare v2 vs v3: Shows we pushed back on indemnification and arbitration

Day 7: Final version agreed
→ Version 4 saved as "counterparty" with analysis showing 0 critical violations
→ Compare v3 vs v4: Shows final compromises made
→ Timeline shows full negotiation history
```

✅ **Negotiation tracking is fully implemented and ready for testing.**

The feature provides:
- Complete version history
- Rich metadata tracking

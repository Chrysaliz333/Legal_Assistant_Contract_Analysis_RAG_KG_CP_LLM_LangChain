- **Feature Requests**: Have an idea for a new feature?
- **Code Contributions**: Want to write code to fix bugs or add features?
- **Documentation**: Help improve our documentation
- **Legal Knowledge**: Contribute to the legal knowledge graph
- **Testing**: Help us test the system with different contract types

### 2. Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (see `.env.example`)
5. Run the notebook to ensure everything works

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate

#### Legal Content Guidelines
- Ensure all legal analysis is educational/informational only
- Include appropriate disclaimers
- Cite sources when adding legal constraints
- Review accuracy with legal professionals when possible

#### Notebook Organization
- Keep cells focused on single concepts
- Use clear markdown headers and documentation
- Include examples and usage instructions
- Test all code cells before committing

### 4. Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: New legal constraint for employment contracts"
   ```

3. Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

4. Update documentation if necessary

5. Push to your fork and create a pull request

6. Fill out the pull request template completely

### 5. Legal Considerations

#### Important Guidelines:
- **No Legal Advice**: This tool provides information, not legal advice
- **Accuracy**: Strive for accuracy but include disclaimers
- **Jurisdiction**: Clearly specify which jurisdictions apply
- **Sources**: Cite authoritative legal sources when possible
- **Disclaimers**: Always include appropriate legal disclaimers

#### Contributing Legal Knowledge:
- Add citations for legal principles
- Specify jurisdiction and date of applicability
- Include examples of how constraints apply
- Test with sample contracts

### 6. Issue Guidelines

#### Bug Reports
Include:
- Python version and OS
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Error messages/screenshots
- Sample contract (anonymized)

#### Feature Requests
Include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and benefits
- Potential implementation approach
- Legal considerations if applicable

### 7. Code Review Process

All contributions go through code review:

1. **Automated Checks**: Basic syntax and style checks
2. **Technical Review**: Code quality and functionality
3. **Legal Review**: Accuracy of legal content
4. **Testing**: Verification with sample contracts

### 8. Development Setup

#### Required Tools:
- Python 3.10.11+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git
- OpenAI API access
- Tavily AI API access

#### Optional Tools:
- VS Code with Python extension
- Black code formatter
- Pytest for testing

### 9. Testing Guidelines

#### Before Submitting:
- Test with multiple contract types
- Verify knowledge graph visualizations
- Check API key handling
- Ensure no sensitive data in commits
- Test error handling

#### Sample Contracts:
- Use publicly available contract templates
- Remove all identifying information
- Include various contract types (NDA, employment, license, etc.)

### 10. Documentation

#### Required Documentation:
- Code comments for complex logic
- Docstrings for all functions/classes
- Usage examples for new features
- Updated README if necessary

### 11. Security Guidelines

#### API Key Safety:
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or `.env` files
- Include `.env` in `.gitignore`
- Provide clear setup instructions

#### Data Privacy:
- Don't include real contract data
- Anonymize all examples
- Follow data protection best practices

### 12. Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help others learn and contribute
- Provide constructive feedback
- Follow the code of conduct

### 13. Questions and Support

- Open an issue for questions
- Join discussions in pull requests
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Be patient with response times

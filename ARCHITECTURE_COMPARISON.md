# Architecture Comparison: Multi-Agent vs Unified Agent

## Problem Statement

The original 4-agent pipeline had fundamental flaws:

1. **Over-application**: Every policy checked against every clause (56 findings for simple contract)
2. **Lack of context**: Clauses analyzed in isolation, missing relationships between sections
3. **Wrong evidence**: Showing policy text instead of contract text as evidence
4. **No suggested edits**: Pipeline complexity prevented actual edit generation

## Solution: Unified Context-Aware Agent

### Old Architecture (Multi-Agent Pipeline)

```
Contract → DiligentReviewer → NeutralRationale → Personality → Editor → Output
             (finds issues)    (generates)       (styles)      (edits)

Problems:
- 4 separate LLM calls per finding (56 × 4 = 224 calls!)
- Each agent works in isolation
- Context lost between stages
- Evidence from wrong source (policy, not contract)
- Complex state management
```

### New Architecture (Unified Agent)

```
Contract + Policies + Style → UnifiedAgent → Output
                               (single call)   (findings + edits)

Benefits:
- 1 LLM call for entire contract
- Full contract context preserved
- Evidence extracted from contract text
- Edits generated in same pass
- Personality applied directly (no separate transformation)
```

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Old Multi-Agent | New Unified Agent |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Context Awareness** | ❌ Isolated clause analysis | ✅ Full contract context |
| **Evidence Source** | ❌ Policy text | ✅ Contract text |
| **Suggested Edits** | ❌ Rarely generated (0/56) | ✅ Always generated (4/4) |
| **Policy Application** | ❌ Over-applied (every policy × every clause) | ✅ Selective (only relevant policies) |
| **Performance** | ⚠️ 56 findings × 4 agents = 224 LLM calls | ✅ 1 LLM call total |
| **Personality** | ⚠️ Separate transformation stage | ✅ Integrated into prompt |
| **Track-Changes** | ⚠️ Separate editor agent | ✅ Built into response |

## Code Comparison

### Old Approach (4 files, ~1500 lines)

```python
# src/agents/diligent_reviewer.py - Find violations
for clause in clauses:
    for policy in policies:
        # Check every combination (N × M complexity)
        finding = await check_clause_against_policy(clause, policy)

# src/agents/neutral_rationale.py - Generate rationales
for finding in findings:
    rationale = await generate_rationale(finding)

# src/agents/personality.py - Apply style
for rationale in rationales:
    transformation = await transform_rationale(rationale, style_params)

# src/agents/editor.py - Create edits
for transformation in transformations:
    edit = await generate_edit(transformation)
```

### New Approach (1 file, ~350 lines)

```python
# src/agents/unified_agent.py - Everything in one pass

async def analyze_contract(contract_text, policies, style_params):
    """
    Single LLM call with full context:
    - Contract text (full document, not isolated clauses)
    - All policies (agent decides relevance)
    - Style instructions (integrated into system prompt)
    - Output schema (findings + edits)
    """

    response = await llm.ainvoke([
        SystemMessage(content=system_prompt_with_personality),
        HumanMessage(content=f"Contract:\n{contract_text}\n\nPolicies:\n{policies}")
    ])

    return parse_json_response(response)  # Includes findings + edits
```

## Real-World Results

### Old Multi-Agent System

```
Sample Contract (771 characters)
├─ Findings: 56
├─ Suggested Edits: 0
├─ Evidence Source: Policy text ❌
├─ Processing Time: ~30-60 seconds
└─ Problems:
   - 56 findings but 0 actionable edits
   - Evidence shows policy requirements, not contract violations
   - Over-application: Every clause flagged multiple times
```

### New Unified Agent

```
Same Contract (771 characters)
├─ Findings: 4 (strict style) / 0 (flexible style)
├─ Suggested Edits: 4 (100% coverage)
├─ Evidence Source: Contract text ✅
├─ Processing Time: ~5-10 seconds
└─ Features:
   - Exact contract quotes as evidence
   - Track-change format edits (deletions + insertions)
   - Context-aware (understands clause relationships)
   - Personality-styled explanations
```

## Example Output Comparison

### Old System - Finding with Wrong Evidence

```json
{
  "finding_id": "f_1234",
  "evidence_quote": "Limitation of liability clauses must specify...",  ← Policy text!
  "explanation": "This deviates from policy requirements...",
  "suggested_edit": null  ← No edit generated
}
```

### New System - Finding with Correct Evidence

```json
{
  "finding_id": "finding_001",
  "contract_evidence": "Contractor's total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the amount of fees paid by Client in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.",  ← Contract text!
  "issue_explanation": "Liability cap must be at least 200% of total fees. Current cap is inadequate.",
  "suggested_edit": {
    "current_text": "Contractor's total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the amount of fees paid by Client in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.",
    "proposed_text": "Contractor's total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed 200% of the total fees paid by Client.",
    "track_changes": {
      "deletions": [{"start": 0, "end": 108, "text": "..."}],
      "insertions": [{"position": 0, "text": "..."}]
    }
  }
}
```

## Memory & Personality Integration

The new unified agent incorporates concepts from Letta (MemGPT) and LangChain Deep Agents:

### Personality (Letta-inspired)

```python
# Personality encoded in system prompt, not separate transformation stage
system_prompt = f"""
{tone_instruction}      # concise/balanced/verbose
{formality_instruction} # legal/plain_english
{aggressiveness_instruction}  # strict/flexible
{audience_instruction}  # internal/counterparty
"""
```

### Context Management (Deep Agent-inspired)

```python
# Full contract context preserved (not isolated clauses)
# Agent sees relationships between sections
# Plans its own analysis strategy
```

## Migration Path

1. **Test unified agent** with existing contracts ✅ Done
2. **Compare results** with old multi-agent output ✅ Done
3. **Integrate into Streamlit UI** - Update app.py to use UnifiedContractAgent
4. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud** with OpenAI key
5. **Deprecate old agents** - Archive diligent_reviewer.py, neutral_rationale.py, personality.py, editor.py

## Recommendations

**Switch to unified agent immediately** because:

1. Fixes all 4 critical issues (context, evidence, edits, over-application)
2. 5-10× faster (1 call vs 224 calls)
3. Simpler codebase (350 lines vs 1500 lines)
4. Better results (4 actionable findings vs 56 noise + 0 edits)
5. Personality integration (no separate transformation stage)

## Next Steps

1. Update `app.py` to use `UnifiedContractAgent` instead of `ContractAnalysisWorkflow`
2. Test with real contracts from your pipeline
3. Fine-tune personality prompts based on user feedback
4. Add memory persistence (optional) for learning from past reviews

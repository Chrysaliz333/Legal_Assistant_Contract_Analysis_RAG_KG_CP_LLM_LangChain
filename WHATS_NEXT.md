- **Findings**: 2-5 remaining violations (improved but still issues)
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Liability cap increased to 1.5× fees
  - Perpetual IP license
  - Mutual indemnification
  - Standard jurisdiction (Delaware)
  - Longer confidentiality (5 years)

### Version Comparison Diff:
```diff

```

## 🐛 Known Issues (None Found Yet)

**If you encounter any issues during testing:**

1. **Import Error**: Check `src/services/negotiation_tracker.py` exists
2. **Session Reset**: Expected on page refresh (Streamlit behavior)
3. **Diff Not Rendering**: Check Streamlit supports `st.code(language='diff')`
4. **File Permission**: Check `negotiations/` directory is writable

## 🚢 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying to Streamlit Cloud:

- [ ] Test full workflow locally (use NEGOTIATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Verify diff display works correctly
- [ ] Test duplicate detection
- [ ] Confirm timeline shows all metadata
- [ ] Fix any bugs found
- [ ] Clean up test negotiations (optional)

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add negotiation tracking feature"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify on Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Check `negotiations/` directory is created
   - Test upload v1 → analyze → check timeline
   - Test upload v2 → analyze → check timeline
   - Test comparison v1 vs v2

3. **Monitor:**
   - File storage growth
   - Diff performance
   - User feedback

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Optional)

**Not required now, but could add later:**

1. **Search**: Full-text search across all versions
2. **Export**: Download timeline as PDF report
3. **Branching**: Support multiple negotiation paths
4. **Database**: Migrate from JSON to PostgreSQL for teams
5. **Compression**: Compress old contract texts
6. **Analytics**: Track which clauses change most often
7. **Notifications**: Alert when counterparty uploads new version
8. **Approval Workflow**: Require approval before accepting changes
